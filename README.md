## Overview

Binary Tree Visualization is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and manipulate a binary search tree (BST) in real-time. Users can add, remove, and search for nodes within the tree, with smooth animations illustrating each operation. The interface supports zooming and panning, enabling easy navigation through complex tree structures.

## Features

- **Add Nodes**: Insert new values into the BST with animated transitions.
- **Remove Nodes**: Delete existing nodes from the tree, visually demonstrating the restructuring process.
- **Search Nodes**: Locate and highlight specific nodes within the tree.
- **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate the tree effortlessly using mouse controls and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layout that works seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## Usage

1. **Add a Node**
   - Enter a numerical value in the input field and click the "Add" button to insert a new node into the BST.
   
2. **Remove a Node**
   - Enter the value of the node you wish to remove and click the "Remove" button.
   
3. **Search for a Node**
   - Enter the value you want to find and click the "Search" button. The node will be highlighted if found.
   
4. **Zoom & Pan**
   - **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or the `[` and `]` keys to zoom in and out.
   - **Pan**: Click and drag the canvas to move around the tree.

## Technologies Used
